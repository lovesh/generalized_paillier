# Paillier encryption and Damgard-Jurik encryption

- Paillier encryption from the paper [Public-Key Cryptosystems Based on Composite Degree Residuosity Classes](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-48910-X_16.pdf). Check [the module](./src/paillier_original.rs) for more docs.
- Generalization of Paillier encryption, called Damgard-Jurik scheme from the paper [A Generalization of Paillierâ€™s Public-Key System with Applications to Electronic Voting](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/voting/papers/DamgardJurikNielsen-AGeneralizationOfPailliersPublicKeySystemWithApplicationsToElectronicVoting.pdf).
Check [the module](./src/damgard_jurik.rs) for more docs

The code is generic over the prime size and expansion factor `S` (for Damgard-Jurik)

By default, it uses standard library and [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) for parallelization.

For `no_std` support, build as

`cargo build --no-default-features`

and for wasm-32, build as

`cargo build --no-default-features --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
